In addition to completing the project, your group will need to maintain a log of who does what throughout the project. The log should be written in **this README** and updated consistently to reflect the group's progression. For more details about what this log should contain, please read the following document https://sof.tware.design/22sp/documents/project-logs.

This project log is **mandatory** - if you do not have a complete and proper project log, **you will not be able to have in-person office hours or code reviews with your TAs**.

Dilichi took control at first and coded vector.c while we discussed algorithmic implementations

Jayden took control for the beginning of vec_list.c defining the struct and writing add and remove, then Dilichi wrote the rest of the functions in vec_list.c

Dilichi and Jayden took turns for each function for polygon.c

Jayden and Dilichi took turns again for bounce.c, most notably Jayden wrote make_star and Dilichi wrote check_collision

Jayden and Dilichi added their own graphical tweaks to bounce.c using custom random functions
