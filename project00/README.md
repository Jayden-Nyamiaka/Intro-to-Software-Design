In addition to completing the project, your group will need to maintain a log of who does what throughout the project. The log should be written in **this README** and updated consistently to reflect the group's progression. For more details about what this log should contain, please read the following document <https://sof.tware.design/22sp/documents/project-logs>. 

This project log is mandatory - if you do not have a complete and proper project log, **you will not be able to have in-person office hours or code reviews with your TAs**.


Jayden cloned the repository to his machine and worked side by side with Dilichi.

Jayden took control first for wc.c writing the checkUsage and countLines functions while discussing the algorithms and new c-specific syntax with Dilichi.

Dilichi took control for longest.c to make the minor changes needed to go from counting lines to keeping track of the longest word.

Jayden and Dilichi alternated back and forth to write the vector.c class with its 3 accompanying functions and the test-vector.c class to test the functionality of vector.c.
